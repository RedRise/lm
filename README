allow you to download subtitles, and interact with the opensubtitles hash 
database.

0 ----- WTF ? -----------------------------------------------------------------

lm lists movie files, getting information on IMDb, allowing you to:
  - display sexy titles (instead of often unreadable filename) in terminal
  - display custom info (outline, actor ...)
  - sort by rating
  - display a global view on an html page with cover and trailer links
  - download subtitles for all your movies
  - share your info, and upload the couple of info (moviehash,imdb_id)
	to opensubtitles database

Remark:
   lm description part is not english oriented. Matchs are done through file
   hash, or non original titles.

Examples:
  python lm.py YOUR_DIR_TO_SCAN -f @genre:action
	will list all your action movies

  python lm.py YOU_DIR_TO_SCAN -s -a
	will display in an HTML page, your movies sorted alphabetically

  python lm.py YOU_DIR_TO_SCAN --download ger
	will download the 3 best subtitles match, for every movie in you dir


1 ----- INSTALLATION ----------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Python packages

    You will need the following packages:
    - IMDbPY: http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/
        * accessible on Ubuntu software center easily (look for pyhton-imdbpy)
        * installation may be more complicated for windows users
		To run properly, lm only needs imdb package at its minimal form
	Note:
        IMDbPY requires 'lxml' to speed up parsing. If not installed, 
        be sure to have 'BeautifulSoup' package.

1.2 Note for Windows users about terminal coloration

    lm is principaly designed to return result on a terminal, as 'ls' function.
    to 'map' terminal coloration on the windows terminal, please install the
    following package:
    - colorama: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama

2 ----- How to use it ? -------------------------------------------------------

2.0 Basic things about scripts and PATH

    lm.py is a simple python script.
    
    How can I call it?
    * At you convenience, add python and the folder containing lm.py in
      your path to be able to call it like that: "python lm.py"
    * You can also make this script executable to call it this way "./lm.py"
    * you can make an alias for your terminal: in that case, we recommend
	to start with this default lm call: "lm.py -r @size:500"
    * Or the hard way, (for windows users for exemple):
     "c:/python/python.exe f:/myscriptfolder/lm.py"

2.1 How to make it return interesting things?

    As always: "python lm.py --help" will give you syntax details

    DEFAULT CALL
        python lm.py
        will analyse the current folder (recursively), 
	* build the movie file hash
	* look fot correspondances in opensubtitles database
	* if nothing found, try to guess title from filename
	* find best match (in all local languages titles)

        result in your terminal (with coloration)

        default behaviour is to scan current directory. Of course this command
        will work as expected:
        python lm.py target_directory_to_screen

    ADVICE:
        Each time you launch lm, it gets metadata for files it doesn't know,
        which is really slow.
        So, be sure to try on a directory with a few movies to test it.

2.2 Colors Meanings
	
    When displayed in your terminal, titles can have different color:
	
	MAGENTA: the best! It means your movie hash matches an opensubtitles
		 known movie. 95% sure to display the right title

	ORANGE : Not bad. We did'nt find any match in opensubtitles, but
		 we looked through imdb movies, and are quite confident.
		 80% chance to display the right title

	ORANGE with RED /|\ symbol: We didn't find anything on opensubtitles
		 And we didnt find any good match in IMDb results neither.
		 We stronly recommend you to manually confirm this movie
		 with the shell interactive command:
		 lm.py YOUR_DIR -f @unsure --confirm
 
2.3 Principal argument

    -l : returns a more complete description, with YEAR, RATE, FILE SIZE
    -L : returns a VERY detailled view with synopsis. Ideal for ONE movie.
        python lm.py -L movie_dir/movie_file.avi 
    -f : filter the query (see 2.4)
    -- confirm: launch an interactive process to confirm/search movies
	        You will be able to confirm found movie (if we are not
		sure), or provide an imdb id, or a title and a year, to
		find the correct match.
    --download: downloads subtitles for selected movies. Subtitles will
		be written in movies directories with suffixe 
		_LANGUAGE_LM1.srt, _LANGUAGE_LM2.srt, ...
		(several subtitles can be downloaded for each movie,
		depending on their popularity)
    -d : delete selected paths from cache.
	 When calling python lm.py YOUR_DIR -d, all movie files in YOUR_DIR
	 will be deleted from cache. Note: A confirmation is asked before
	 any deletion.
	 To delete all cache call: python "lm.py cache -d"
	 
    HTML DISPLAY
    -s : will open you web browser and display results with rates, cover,
         links to trailers, and IMDb movie page.

	

2.4 ----- Filters -------------------------------------------------------------


    you can filter your query using the --filter argument (or the short -f).
    Currently, you can filter on:
        genre
        director
        actor
        size (bigger than xxMb)
	unsure (movies wich hash not found in opensubtitles, and bad title
		match in imdb results) 

    he syntax is --filter @keyword:filter,filter,filter@keyword2:filter,filter

    e.g.:
    python lm.py -f "@director:tim burton@genre:drama,fantasy@size:500"
    python lm.py -f @unsure@size:500
    Filters are case insensitive.

2.5 ----- Download Subtitles --------------------------------------------------

  lm download subtitles for all movie files selected.

  Before any downloading, you need to determine the language ISO639 code.
  3 letters (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes)

  python lm.py YOUR_DIR --download eng
    * will recursively go through YOUR_DIR, and search for english subtitles
    * will write subtitles in every movie file directory with syntax
      moviefilename_ENG_LM1.srt, moviefilename_ENG_LM2.srt

  lm will download up to 3 most downloaded subtitles with preference to
  subtitles that match movie hash.

3 ----- MECHANISMS -------------------------------------------------------------

    CACHE AND HTML DISPLAY

    Basically, all metadata (text data, not pictures) are stored with pickle
    in the hidden directory 
	~/.lm/cache_path: storing absolute paths and hashs
	~/.lm/cache_hash: storing hashs and metadatas

    HTML file (build when -s parameter is used) is stored in:
	~/.lm/html_sumup.html


    MOVIE SEARCH

    Since v2.0:
	1/ Build hash for file 
	   (see: http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/XMLRPC)
	2/ Call opensubtitle through XMLRPC call. Do they know this hash?
	3/ If yes: -> perfect, we get an imdb_id, GO TO
	4/ Try to guess movie title/year with filename
        	clean filename, omit some stop words
		look for a potential year in the movie filename
        5/ Send guessed title to IMDB
        6/ if we guessed a year, reduce answers to guessed year movies
        7/ find best match on all results, for ALL AKAS (non original title)
	8/ if the best match isn't very good, and if we reduced answer at
		step 6, GOTO 7 with non filtered answers

    REMARK: lm.py is not english oriented at all. exemple "sexcrimes.avi" will
        match "wild things" original title.
